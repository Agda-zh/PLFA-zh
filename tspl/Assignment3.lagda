Exercises without a label are optional, and may be done if you want
some extra practice.

#### Exercise `reverse-++-commute` (recommended)

Show that the reverse of one list appended to another is the
reverse of the second appended to the reverse of the first.
\begin{code}
postulate
  reverse-++-commute : ∀ {A : Set} {xs ys : List A}
    → reverse (xs ++ ys) ≡ reverse ys ++ reverse xs
\end{code}

#### Exercise `reverse-involutive` (recommended)

A function is an _involution_ if when applied twice it acts
as the identity function.  Show that reverse is an involution.
\begin{code}
postulate
  reverse-involutive : ∀ {A : Set} {xs : List A}
    → reverse (reverse xs) ≡ xs
\end{code}

#### Exercise `map-compose`

Prove that the map of a composition is equal to the composition of two maps.
\begin{code}
postulate
  map-compose : ∀ {A B C : Set} {f : A → B} {g : B → C}
    → map (g ∘ f) ≡ map g ∘ map f
\end{code}
The last step of the proof requires extensionality.

#### Exercise `map-++-commute`

Prove the following relationship between map and append.
\begin{code}
postulate
  map-++-commute : ∀ {A B : Set} {f : A → B} {xs ys : List A}
   →  map f (xs ++ ys) ≡ map f xs ++ map f ys
\end{code}

#### Exercise `map-Tree`

Define a type of trees with leaves of type `A` and internal
nodes of type `B`.
\begin{code}
data Tree (A B : Set) : Set where
  leaf : A → Tree A B
  node : Tree A B → B → Tree A B → Tree A B
\end{code}
Define a suitabve map operator over trees.
\begin{code}
postulate
  map-Tree : ∀ {A B C D : Set}
    → (A → C) → (B → D) → Tree A B → Tree C D
\end{code}

#### Exercise `product` (recommended)

Use fold to define a function to find the product of a list of numbers.
For example,

    product [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] ≡ 24

#### Exercise `foldr-++` (recommended)

Show that fold and append are related as follows.
\begin{code}
postulate
  foldr-++ : ∀ {A B : Set} (_⊗_ : A → B → B) (e : B) (xs ys : List A) →
    foldr _⊗_ e (xs ++ ys) ≡ foldr _⊗_ (foldr _⊗_ e ys) xs
\end{code}


#### Exercise `map-is-foldr`

Show that map can be defined using fold.
\begin{code}
postulate
  map-is-foldr : ∀ {A B : Set} {f : A → B} →
    map f ≡ foldr (λ x xs → f x ∷ xs) []
\end{code}
This requires extensionality.

#### Exercise `fold-Tree`

Define a suitable fold function for the type of trees given earlier.
\begin{code}
postulate
  fold-Tree : ∀ {A B C : Set}
    → (A → C) → (C → B → C → C) → Tree A B → C
\end{code}

#### Exercise `map-is-fold-Tree`

Demonstrate an anologue of `map-is-foldr` for the type of trees.

#### Exercise `sum-downFrom` (stretch)

Define a function that counts down as follows.
\begin{code}
downFrom : ℕ → List ℕ
downFrom zero     =  []
downFrom (suc n)  =  n ∷ downFrom n
\end{code}
For example,
\begin{code}
_ : downFrom 3 ≡ [ 2 , 1 , 0 ]
_ = refl
\end{code}
Prove that the sum of the numbers `(n - 1) + ⋯ + 0` is
equal to `n * (n ∸ 1) / 2`.
\begin{code}
postulate
  sum-downFrom : ∀ (n : ℕ)
    → sum (downFrom n) * 2 ≡ n * (n ∸ 1)
\end{code}


#### Exercise `foldl`

Define a function `foldl` which is analogous to `foldr`, but where
operations associate to the left rather than the right.  For example,

    foldr _⊗_ e [ x , y , z ]  =  x ⊗ (y ⊗ (z ⊗ e))
    foldl _⊗_ e [ x , y , z ]  =  ((e ⊗ x) ⊗ y) ⊗ z


#### Exercise `foldr-monoid-foldl`

Show that if `_⊕_` and `e` form a monoid, then `foldr _⊗_ e` and
`foldl _⊗_ e` always compute the same result.


#### Exercise `Any-++-⇔` (recommended)

Prove a result similar to `All-++-↔`, but with `Any` in place of `All`, and a suitable
replacement for `_×_`.  As a consequence, demonstrate an equivalence relating
`_∈_` and `_++_`.


#### Exercise `All-++-≃` (stretch)

Show that the equivalence `All-++-⇔` can be extended to an isomorphism.


#### Exercise `¬Any≃All¬` (stretch)

First generalise composition to arbitrary levels, using
[universe polymorphism][plfa.Equality#unipoly].
\begin{code}
_∘′_ : ∀ {ℓ₁ ℓ₂ ℓ₃ : Level} {A : Set ℓ₁} {B : Set ℓ₂} {C : Set ℓ₃}
  → (B → C) → (A → B) → A → C
(g ∘′ f) x  =  g (f x)
\end{code}

Show that `Any` and `All` satisfy a version of De Morgan's Law.
\begin{code}
postulate
  ¬Any≃All¬ : ∀ {A : Set} (P : A → Set) (xs : List A)
    → (¬_ ∘′ Any P) xs ≃ All (¬_ ∘′ P) xs
\end{code}

Do we also have the following?
\begin{code}
postulate
  ¬All≃Any¬ : ∀ {A : Set} (P : A → Set) (xs : List A)
    → (¬_ ∘′ All P) xs ≃ Any (¬_ ∘′ P) xs
\end{code}
If so, prove; if not, explain why.


#### Exercise `any?` (stretch)

Just as `All` has analogues `all` and `all?` which determine whether a
predicate holds for every element of a list, so does `Any` have
analogues `any` and `any?` which determine whether a predicates holds
for some element of a list.  Give their definitions.


#### Exercise `filter?` (stretch)

Define the following variant of the traditional `filter` function on lists,
which given a list and a decidable predicate returns all elements of the
list satisfying the predicate.
\begin{code}
postulate
  filter? : ∀ {A : Set} {P : A → Set}
    → (P? : Decidable P) → List A → ∃[ ys ]( All P ys )
\end{code}


## Lambda

#### Exercise `mul` (recommended)

Write out the definition of a lambda term that multiplies
two natural numbers.


#### Exercise `primed` (stretch)

We can make examples with lambda terms slightly easier to write
by adding the following definitions.
\begin{code}
ƛ′_⇒_ : Term → Term → Term
ƛ′ (` x) ⇒ N  =  ƛ x ⇒ N
ƛ′ _ ⇒ _      =  ⊥-elim impossible
  where postulate impossible : ⊥

case′_[zero⇒_|suc_⇒_] : Term → Term → Term → Term → Term
case′ L [zero⇒ M |suc (` x) ⇒ N ]  =  case L [zero⇒ M |suc x ⇒ N ]
case′ _ [zero⇒ _ |suc _ ⇒ _ ]      =  ⊥-elim impossible
  where postulate impossible : ⊥

μ′_⇒_ : Term → Term → Term
μ′ (` x) ⇒ N  =  μ x ⇒ N
μ′ _ ⇒ _      =  ⊥-elim impossible
  where postulate impossible : ⊥
\end{code}
The definition of `plus` can now be written as follows.
\begin{code}
plus′ : Term
plus′ = μ′ + ⇒ ƛ′ m ⇒ ƛ′ n ⇒
          case′ m
            [zero⇒ n
            |suc m ⇒ `suc (+ · m · n) ]
  where
  +  =  ` "+"
  m  =  ` "m"
  n  =  ` "n"
\end{code}
Write out the definition of multiplication in the same style.

#### Exercise `_[_:=_]′` (stretch)

The definition of substitution above has three clauses (`ƛ`, `case`,
and `μ`) that invoke a with clause to deal with bound variables.
Rewrite the definition to factor the common part of these three
clauses into a single function, defined by mutual recursion with
substitution.


#### Exercise `—↠≃—↠′`

Show that the two notions of reflexive and transitive closure
above are isomorphic.


#### Exercise `plus-example`

Write out the reduction sequence demonstrating that one plus one is two.


#### Exercise `mul-type` (recommended)

Using the term `mul` you defined earlier, write out the derivation
showing that it is well-typed.


## Properties


#### Exercise `Progress-≃`

Show that `Progress M` is isomorphic to `Value M ⊎ ∃[ N ](M —→ N)`.


#### Exercise `progress′`

Write out the proof of `progress′` in full, and compare it to the
proof of `progress` above.


#### Exercise `value?`

Combine `progress` and `—→¬V` to write a program that decides
whether a well-typed term is a value.
\begin{code}
postulate
  value? : ∀ {A M} → ∅ ⊢ M ⦂ A → Dec (Value M)
\end{code}


#### Exercise `subst′` (stretch)

Rewrite `subst` to work with the modified definition `_[_:=_]′`
from the exercise in the previous chapter.  As before, this
should factor dealing with bound variables into a single function,
defined by mutual recursion with the proof that substitution
preserves types.


#### Exercise `mul-example` (recommended)

Using the evaluator, confirm that two times two is four.


#### Exercise: `progress-preservation`

Without peeking at their statements above, write down the progress
and preservation theorems for the simply typed lambda-calculus.


#### Exercise `subject-expansion`

We say that `M` _reduces_ to `N` if `M —→ N`,
and conversely that `M` _expands_ to `N` if `N —→ M`.
The preservation property is sometimes called _subject reduction_.
Its opposite is _subject expansion_, which holds if
`M —→ N` and `∅ ⊢ N ⦂ A` imply `∅ ⊢ M ⦂ A`.
Find two counter-examples to subject expansion, one
with case expressions and one not involving case expressions.


#### Exercise `stuck`

Give an example of an ill-typed term that does get stuck.


#### Exercise `unstuck` (recommended)

Provide proofs of the three postulates, `unstuck`, `preserves`, and `wttdgs` above.
