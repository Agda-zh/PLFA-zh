## Introduction

<!-- This assignment is due **4pm Thursday 1 November** (Week 7). -->

You must do _all_ the exercises labelled "(recommended)".

Exercises labelled "(stretch)" are there to provide an extra challenge.
You don't need to do all of these, but should attempt at least a few.

Exercises without a label are optional, and may be done if you want
some extra practice.

<!-- Submit your homework using the "submit" command. -->
Please ensure your files execute correctly under Agda!

## Lambda

#### Exercise `mul` (recommended)

Write out the definition of a lambda term that multiplies
two natural numbers.


#### Exercise `primed` (stretch)

We can make examples with lambda terms slightly easier to write
by adding the following definitions.
\begin{code}
ƛ′_⇒_ : Term → Term → Term
ƛ′ (` x) ⇒ N  =  ƛ x ⇒ N
ƛ′ _ ⇒ _      =  ⊥-elim impossible
  where postulate impossible : ⊥

case′_[zero⇒_|suc_⇒_] : Term → Term → Term → Term → Term
case′ L [zero⇒ M |suc (` x) ⇒ N ]  =  case L [zero⇒ M |suc x ⇒ N ]
case′ _ [zero⇒ _ |suc _ ⇒ _ ]      =  ⊥-elim impossible
  where postulate impossible : ⊥

μ′_⇒_ : Term → Term → Term
μ′ (` x) ⇒ N  =  μ x ⇒ N
μ′ _ ⇒ _      =  ⊥-elim impossible
  where postulate impossible : ⊥
\end{code}
The definition of `plus` can now be written as follows.
\begin{code}
plus′ : Term
plus′ = μ′ + ⇒ ƛ′ m ⇒ ƛ′ n ⇒
          case′ m
            [zero⇒ n
            |suc m ⇒ `suc (+ · m · n) ]
  where
  +  =  ` "+"
  m  =  ` "m"
  n  =  ` "n"
\end{code}
Write out the definition of multiplication in the same style.

#### Exercise `_[_:=_]′` (stretch)

The definition of substitution above has three clauses (`ƛ`, `case`,
and `μ`) that invoke a with clause to deal with bound variables.
Rewrite the definition to factor the common part of these three
clauses into a single function, defined by mutual recursion with
substitution.


#### Exercise `—↠≃—↠′`

Show that the two notions of reflexive and transitive closure
above are isomorphic.


#### Exercise `plus-example`

Write out the reduction sequence demonstrating that one plus one is two.


#### Exercise `mul-type` (recommended)

Using the term `mul` you defined earlier, write out the derivation
showing that it is well-typed.


## Properties


#### Exercise `Progress-≃`

Show that `Progress M` is isomorphic to `Value M ⊎ ∃[ N ](M —→ N)`.


#### Exercise `progress′`

Write out the proof of `progress′` in full, and compare it to the
proof of `progress` above.


#### Exercise `value?`

Combine `progress` and `—→¬V` to write a program that decides
whether a well-typed term is a value.
\begin{code}
postulate
  value? : ∀ {A M} → ∅ ⊢ M ⦂ A → Dec (Value M)
\end{code}


#### Exercise `subst′` (stretch)

Rewrite `subst` to work with the modified definition `_[_:=_]′`
from the exercise in the previous chapter.  As before, this
should factor dealing with bound variables into a single function,
defined by mutual recursion with the proof that substitution
preserves types.


#### Exercise `mul-example` (recommended)

Using the evaluator, confirm that two times two is four.


#### Exercise: `progress-preservation`

Without peeking at their statements above, write down the progress
and preservation theorems for the simply typed lambda-calculus.


#### Exercise `subject-expansion`

We say that `M` _reduces_ to `N` if `M —→ N`,
and conversely that `M` _expands_ to `N` if `N —→ M`.
The preservation property is sometimes called _subject reduction_.
Its opposite is _subject expansion_, which holds if
`M —→ N` and `∅ ⊢ N ⦂ A` imply `∅ ⊢ M ⦂ A`.
Find two counter-examples to subject expansion, one
with case expressions and one not involving case expressions.


#### Exercise `stuck`

Give an example of an ill-typed term that does get stuck.


#### Exercise `unstuck` (recommended)

Provide proofs of the three postulates, `unstuck`, `preserves`, and `wttdgs` above.
