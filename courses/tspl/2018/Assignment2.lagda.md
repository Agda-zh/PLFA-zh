Exercises without a label are optional, and may be done if you want
some extra practice.

## Equality

#### Exercise `≤-reasoning` (stretch)

The proof of monotonicity from
Chapter [Relations][plfa.Relations]
can be written in a more readable form by using an anologue of our
notation for `≡-reasoning`.  Define `≤-reasoning` analogously, and use
it to write out an alternative proof that addition is monotonic with
regard to inequality.  Rewrite both `+-monoˡ-≤` and `+-mono-≤`.



## Isomorphism

#### Exercise `≃-implies-≲`

Show that every isomorphism implies an embedding.
```
postulate
  ≃-implies-≲ : ∀ {A B : Set}
    → A ≃ B
      -----
    → A ≲ B
```

#### Exercise `_⇔_` (recommended) {#iff}

Define equivalence of propositions (also known as "if and only if") as follows.
```
record _⇔_ (A B : Set) : Set where
  field
    to   : A → B
    from : B → A

open _⇔_
```
Show that equivalence is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

#### Exercise `Bin-embedding` (stretch) {#Bin-embedding}

Recall that Exercises
[Bin][plfa.Naturals#Bin] and
[Bin-laws][plfa.Induction#Bin-laws]
define a datatype of bitstrings representing natural numbers.
```
data Bin : Set where
  nil : Bin
  x0_ : Bin → Bin
  x1_ : Bin → Bin
```
And ask you to define the following functions:

    to : ℕ → Bin
    from : Bin → ℕ

which satisfy the following property:

    from (to n) ≡ n

Using the above, establish that there is an embedding of `ℕ` into `Bin`.
Why is there not an isomorphism?


## Connectives

#### Exercise `⇔≃×` (recommended)

Show that `A ⇔ B` as defined [earlier][plfa.Isomorphism#iff]
is isomorphic to `(A → B) × (B → A)`.

#### Exercise `⊎-comm` (recommended)

Show sum is commutative up to isomorphism.

#### Exercise `⊎-assoc`

Show sum is associative up to ismorphism.

#### Exercise `⊥-identityˡ` (recommended)

Show zero is the left identity of addition.

#### Exercise `⊥-identityʳ`

Show zero is the right identity of addition.

#### Exercise `⊎-weak-×` (recommended)

Show that the following property holds.
```
postulate
  ⊎-weak-× : ∀ {A B C : Set} → (A ⊎ B) × C → A ⊎ (B × C)
```
This is called a _weak distributive law_. Give the corresponding
distributive law, and explain how it relates to the weak version.

#### Exercise `⊎×-implies-×⊎`

Show that a disjunct of conjuncts implies a conjunct of disjuncts.
```
postulate
  ⊎×-implies-×⊎ : ∀ {A B C D : Set} → (A × B) ⊎ (C × D) → (A ⊎ C) × (B ⊎ D)
```
Does the converse hold? If so, prove; if not, give a counterexample.


## Negation

#### Exercise `<-irreflexive` (recommended)

Using negation, show that
[strict inequality][plfa.Relations#strict-inequality]
is irreflexive, that is, `n < n` holds for no `n`.


#### Exercise `trichotomy`

Show that strict inequality satisfies
[trichotomy][plfa.Relations#trichotomy],
that is, for any naturals `m` and `n` exactly one of the following holds:

* `m < n`
* `m ≡ n`
* `m > n`

Here "exactly one" means that one of the three must hold, and each implies the
negation of the other two.


#### Exercise `⊎-dual-×` (recommended)

Show that conjunction, disjunction, and negation are related by a
version of De Morgan's Law.

    ¬ (A ⊎ B) ≃ (¬ A) × (¬ B)

This result is an easy consequence of something we've proved previously.

Do we also have the following?

    ¬ (A × B) ≃ (¬ A) ⊎ (¬ B)

If so, prove; if not, give a variant that does hold.


#### Exercise `Classical` (stretch)

Consider the following principles.

  * Excluded Middle: `A ⊎ ¬ A`, for all `A`
  * Double Negation Elimination: `¬ ¬ A → A`, for all `A`
  * Peirce's Law: `((A → B) → A) → A`, for all `A` and `B`.
  * Implication as disjunction: `(A → B) → ¬ A ⊎ B`, for all `A` and `B`.
  * De Morgan: `¬ (¬ A × ¬ B) → A ⊎ B`, for all `A` and `B`.

Show that each of these implies all the others.


#### Exercise `Stable` (stretch)

Say that a formula is _stable_ if double negation elimination holds for it.
```
Stable : Set → Set
Stable A = ¬ ¬ A → A
```
Show that any negated formula is stable, and that the conjunction
of two stable formulas is stable.


## Quantifiers

#### Exercise `∀-distrib-×` (recommended)

Show that universals distribute over conjunction.
```
postulate
  ∀-distrib-× : ∀ {A : Set} {B C : A → Set} →
    (∀ (x : A) → B x × C x) ≃ (∀ (x : A) → B x) × (∀ (x : A) → C x)
```
Compare this with the result (`→-distrib-×`) in
Chapter [Connectives][plfa.Connectives].

#### Exercise `⊎∀-implies-∀⊎`

Show that a disjunction of universals implies a universal of disjunctions.
```
postulate
  ⊎∀-implies-∀⊎ : ∀ {A : Set} { B C : A → Set } →
    (∀ (x : A) → B x) ⊎ (∀ (x : A) → C x)  →  ∀ (x : A) → B x ⊎ C x
```
Does the converse hold? If so, prove; if not, explain why.

#### Exercise `∃-distrib-⊎` (recommended)

Show that existentials distribute over disjunction.
```
postulate
  ∃-distrib-⊎ : ∀ {A : Set} {B C : A → Set} →
    ∃[ x ] (B x ⊎ C x) ≃ (∃[ x ] B x) ⊎ (∃[ x ] C x)
```

#### Exercise `∃×-implies-×∃`

Show that an existential of conjunctions implies a conjunction of existentials.
```
postulate
  ∃×-implies-×∃ : ∀ {A : Set} { B C : A → Set } →
    ∃[ x ] (B x × C x) → (∃[ x ] B x) × (∃[ x ] C x)
```
Does the converse hold? If so, prove; if not, explain why.

#### Exercise `∃-even-odd`

How do the proofs become more difficult if we replace `m * 2` and `1 + m * 2`
by `2 * m` and `2 * m + 1`?  Rewrite the proofs of `∃-even` and `∃-odd` when
restated in this way.

#### Exercise `∃-+-≤`

Show that `y ≤ z` holds if and only if there exists a `x` such that
`x + y ≡ z`.

#### Exercise `∃¬-implies-¬∀` (recommended)

Show that existential of a negation implies negation of a universal.
```
postulate
  ∃¬-implies-¬∀ : ∀ {A : Set} {B : A → Set}
    → ∃[ x ] (¬ B x)
      --------------
    → ¬ (∀ x → B x)
```
Does the converse hold? If so, prove; if not, explain why.


#### Exercise `Bin-isomorphism` (stretch) {#Bin-isomorphism}

Recall that Exercises
[Bin][plfa.Naturals#Bin],
[Bin-laws][plfa.Induction#Bin-laws], and
[Bin-predicates][plfa.Relations#Bin-predicates]
define a datatype of bitstrings representing natural numbers.

    data Bin : Set where
      nil : Bin
      x0_ : Bin → Bin
      x1_ : Bin → Bin

And ask you to define the following functions and predicates.

    to   : ℕ → Bin
    from : Bin → ℕ
    Can  : Bin → Set

And to establish the following properties.

    from (to n) ≡ n

    ----------
    Can (to n)

    Can x
    ---------------
    to (from x) ≡ x

Using the above, establish that there is an isomorphism between `ℕ` and
`∃[ x ](Can x)`.


## Decidable

#### Exercise `_<?_` (recommended)

Analogous to the function above, define a function to decide strict inequality.
```
postulate
  _<?_ : ∀ (m n : ℕ) → Dec (m < n)
```

#### Exercise `_≡ℕ?_`

Define a function to decide whether two naturals are equal.
```
postulate
  _≡ℕ?_ : ∀ (m n : ℕ) → Dec (m ≡ n)
```


#### Exercise `erasure`

Show that erasure relates corresponding boolean and decidable operations.
```
postulate
  ∧-× : ∀ {A B : Set} (x : Dec A) (y : Dec B) → ⌊ x ⌋ ∧ ⌊ y ⌋ ≡ ⌊ x ×-dec y ⌋
  ∨-× : ∀ {A B : Set} (x : Dec A) (y : Dec B) → ⌊ x ⌋ ∨ ⌊ y ⌋ ≡ ⌊ x ⊎-dec y ⌋
  not-¬ : ∀ {A : Set} (x : Dec A) → not ⌊ x ⌋ ≡ ⌊ ¬? x ⌋
```

#### Exercise `iff-erasure` (recommended)

Give analogues of the `_⇔_` operation from
Chapter [Isomorphism][plfa.Isomorphism#iff],
operation on booleans and decidables, and also show the corresponding erasure.
```
postulate
  _iff_ : Bool → Bool → Bool
  _⇔-dec_ : ∀ {A B : Set} → Dec A → Dec B → Dec (A ⇔ B)
  iff-⇔ : ∀ {A B : Set} (x : Dec A) (y : Dec B) → ⌊ x ⌋ iff ⌊ y ⌋ ≡ ⌊ x ⇔-dec y ⌋
```
